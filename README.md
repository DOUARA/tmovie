## Description 

T-Movie is a mobile optimized React application that is like "Tinder for Movies". The application chooses random assets from the collection of all popular movies and shows its image cover and title. The user can decide whether they like the movie or not by pressing on the correct button. If they like it, they press the Love (Like) button, if they do not, they press the Poo (Dislike) button. Additionally the user is also able to use swipe to the right if they like it and to the left if they dislike it. All loved/liked assets get stored in the user profile. As soon it's saved successfully, the next asset cover will appear.

The data is fetched from the Movie Database and the favourite movies are stored in the connected user account. All API endpoints are available in the [documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

Instead of using JavaScript I have decided to use Typescript for cleaner and more maintainable code. 

The logic behind fetching the random movies is modeled with an activity UML diagram in `diagrams.mdg` that you can open using [StarUML software](https://staruml.io/)

## Add your own API key 

You will need to add your own [moviedb API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/) in `.env` file, which you can get from the settings section in your account.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
